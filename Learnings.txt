1) How to setup a professional backend project
npm init
touch gitbash
.gitkeep
module.js
devdep dep
mkdir
prettier


2) How to connect database in MERN with debugging
no allow access from anywhere in production ip address 0.0.0.0/0
remove / from url of mongodb connection string
wrap db in try catch / promise when communicate
db is always another continent async await time lagta h
; before iffe in professional envirment
throw / process.exit
connection instance:log
dotenv = as early as possible in your application import and configure dotenv
nodemon -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/index.js


3) Custom api response and error handling
middleware's/configurations are used by app.use
CORS_ORIGIN = *
explore cors
//accepting json
app.use(express.json({limit:"16kb"}))
file uploading handles multer
its hard to extrat data from url m+a/m%20a
cookie parser is used to perform crud ops on server
(err, req, res, next)
repeating code is written in utils like trycatch and async await of db
higher order function treats functions like variables
node.js api error
this.data
Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)


4) User and video model with hooks and JWT
mongodata save user in bson data

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the human-readable data interchange format you interact with, while BSON (Binary JSON) is the internal, binary-encoded format that MongoDB uses for efficient storage and high performance

When you insert a JSON document into MongoDB, the database automatically converts it to BSON for storage. When you query data, the drivers convert the retrieved BSON back into JSON-like objects (e.g., Python dictionaries, JavaScript objects) in your application.

"User" will become plural and lowercase --> "users"
to make field searchable in db make index true
timestamps:true makes createdAt and updatedAt
mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2
bcrypt jwt
pre hook : runs just before saving data encrypt password
pre takes normal function because arrow func doest have this. property
methods .compare
jwt is a bearer token => who owns data given like a key (secure)
refresh token payload has less data because of continuous refresh

5) How to upload file in backend | Multer
first take file from user and upload on server/local storage and then upload to cloudinary through multer because if user entered wrong file he has chance to edit

if file uploaded well remove from server too
server restart when env touched
multer middleware documentation
difference between multer disk and memory storage
multer, cors

6) HTTP crash course | http Methods | http headers
 url,uri,urn uniform resource locater/identifier
HTTP headers req, res
headers do caching, authentication(token, bearer), manage state
req head -> client
res head -> server
representation header -> encoding/compression
payload(fancy name of data) head -> data
most common headers -> accept, auth, cookie, content-type, cache
cors, security headers
optimize data structure to avoid delay of the user
